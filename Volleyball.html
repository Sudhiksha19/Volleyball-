  <p class="sofia-regular">Volleyball, game played by two teams, usually of six players on a side, in which the players use their hands to bat a ball back and forth over a high net, trying to make the ball touch the court within the opponents’ playing area before it can be returned. To prevent this a player on the opposing team bats the ball up and toward a teammate before it touches the court surface—that teammate may then volley it back across the net or bat it to a third teammate who volleys it across the net. A team is allowed only three touches of the ball before it must be returned over the net.Only 6 players on the floor at any given time: 3 in the front row and 3 in the back row.
Points are made on every serve for the winning team of the rally (rally-point scoring).Players may not hit the ball twice in succession (a block is not considered a hit)</p>
