<p class="sofia-regular"> Club Volleyball or often called JO volleyball (Junior Olympic Volleyball), are organizations that train athletes in the sport of volleyball so they can compete following the normal school season. Volleyball clubs are independent of each other and privately owned. Club Volleyball is also quite expensive, but benefits the player's game quite a lot. Club Volleyball is more fierce than normal school season. The club's name is being carried, so they want us to win as much as possible. Tryout are held to be selected and the coaches can only take up 12-18 players on a team. Rotation are a part of club more than it is of normal school volleyball. </p>
